# Blockchain-Backed Fine-Grained Access Control for Healthcare IoT Data

## Overview
This project proposes a secure and privacy-preserving framework for managing healthcare IoT (IoMT) data using blockchain technology. It addresses challenges such as centralized data breaches, lack of transparency, and unauthorized access to sensitive patient information.

## Problem Statement
Traditional healthcare IoT systems rely on centralized cloud servers and role-based access control, which are vulnerable to:
- Single point of failure
- Insider threats
- Lack of tamper-proof audit trails

## Proposed Solution
- AES-128 encryption at the IoT edge
- Off-chain storage using ThingSpeak
- On-chain fine-grained access control using Ethereum smart contracts
- Immutable audit trail for all data access events

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Blockchain (Ethereum)
- Smart Contracts
- AES Encryption
- ThingSpeak Cloud
- IoT (ESP32 Simulation)
- Ganache Test Network
- Web3.py

## Key Features
- Encrypted healthcare data storage
- Decentralized access control
- Secure doctor authentication
- Tamper-proof audit logging
- Low-latency data retrieval

## Results
- Avalanche Effect ≈ 47.66%
- Shannon Entropy ≈ 7.99
- Demonstrated strong resistance to pattern-matching attacks
- Suitable for real-time healthcare monitoring
